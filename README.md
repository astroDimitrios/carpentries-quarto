# Carpentries Quarto Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template astrodimitrios/carpentries-quarto
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

*TODO*: Describe how to use your format.

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](example.qmd).

## Dev

```shell
npm install
```

If you're on Windows and the postinstall script doesn't run then open bash and run it manually.

```shell
.postinstall.sh
```

then run the squash scripts:

```shell
.squash-a-script.sh
.squash-sass.sh
```
